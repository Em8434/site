  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  
<p><h3><p>In the course of history, 100 years isn't a particularly long time. But in the course of fashion history, it's the difference
  between trying to get around in a bone-cinching girdle and ankle-length skirt and easing into the Nike leggings and Vans sneakers
  you're probably wearing today. In the intervening years, there have been major shifts in technology, politics, culture, and social norms,
  and fashion has reflected that in its ever-changing cycle of trends. From the sky-high platforms of the '70s to the high-waisted bikinis of
  the '40s, we see plenty of the popular looks of decades past serving as inspiration for designers today. Below, take a look back at the most influential
  trends from the 1900s through today</p></h3>
