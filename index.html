  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  
<h2> <p> <In the course of history, 100 years isn't a particularly long time. But in the course of fashion history, it's the difference<br> 
  between trying to get around in a bone-cinching girdle and ankle-length skirt and easing into the Nike leggings and Vans sneakers<br>
  you're probably wearing today. In the intervening years, there have been major shifts in technology, politics, culture, and social norms,<br>
  and fashion has reflected that in its ever-changing cycle of trends. From the sky-high platforms of the '70s to the high-waisted bikinis of<br>
  the '40s, we see plenty of the popular looks of decades past serving as inspiration for designers today. Below, take a look back at the most influential<br>
  trends from the 1900s through today<br><p><h2>
