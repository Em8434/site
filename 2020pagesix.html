  <h1>2020</h1>
  
  <p>  The fashions of the 2020s represent a departure from 2010s fashion. They have been largely inspired by styles of the early to mid 2000s, late 1990s, 1980s, 1970s, and 1960s. Popular brands in the United Kingdom, United States, and Australia during this era include Adidas, Nike, New Balance, Globe International, Vans, Kappa, Tommy Hilfiger, Asics, Ellesse, Ralph Lauren, Forever 21, Playboy, and The North Face.</p>

<p>

During the 2020s, many companies, including current fashion giants, such as Shein and Shekou, have been using social media platforms such as TikTok and Instagram as a marketing tool. Marketing strategies involving third parties, particularly influencers and celebrities, have become prominent promotional tactics. E-commerce platforms such as Depop and Etsy grew by offering vintage, homemade, or resold clothing from individual sellers. Their goal is to promote and support small businesses and the environment, instead of major retailers.</p>

Early 2020s (2020–2022)

<p>

As the decade began, fashions of the late 1990s and early to mid-2000s made a comeback, as many younger women in the UK, Australia, the US, Europe, and Asia rejected the form-fitting clothes that were a staple of 2010s fashion. In late 2020, younger British and American women abandoned skinny jeans for sweatpants; sweat suits; leggings; bike shorts; baggy shorts; mom jeans; low rise pants; overalls; shortalls; pants with drawstring waists; studded belts; zip up denim jumpsuits with large pockets; boot cut pants and leggings; pink velour tracksuits; leather skirts; ankle length skirts sometimes made from sheer fabric; baggy pants; and culottes.</p>
<p>
From 2020-2022, desirable colors in the US and Europe included navy blue, neon green, electric blue, purple, black, white, coral, baby pink, light grey, silver, pastel pink, violet, pale blue, lavender, mint green, faded yellow, pastel teal, lemon yellow, orange, red, and brown.</p>

Popular shirts, coats, and dresses from this time included puffer jackets made from upcycled deadstock fabric, sweatshirts, high waisted pants, tucked-in sweaters, camisoles and crop tops, lowrise miniskirts, brocade topcoats, midriff-baring tops, ribbed turtlenecks, garish Ed Hardy style T-shirts with rhinestones, off-the-shoulder knitted tops, science fiction-inspired metallic jackets, loose-fitting shift dresses  or blouses, pantywaist tops sometimes with cap sleeves, cashmere cardigans, and oversized 1980s-inspired dog's tooth check jackets popularized by Kaia Gerber and Miley Cyrus.</p>
<p>
Shoe and accessory styles changed as Crocs, platform sandals, knee-high boots, ballet flats, white sneakers (such as Vans, Keds, Nike Air Force 1s, or Converse), fringed handbags, multi-coloured 1980s-inspired earrings made from recycled ocean plastic, white bralettes, chunky cable knit scarves, Chelsea boots, and Doc Martens became popular.</p>
<p>
These women shifted to fair trade, vintage, and cruelty-free clothing. Fashion-conscious British women rejected nylon, acrylic, rayon, new cotton, and polyester in favour of tencel, linen, organic cotton, and recycled polyester. Workplace dress codes became more casual due to a higher proportion of remote workers among white collar staff. Many professional women, especially in the UK and America, paired a formal blouse with casual leg wear like shorts or even pajama bottoms on video conferences.</p>

In India, Pakistan, and Ceylon, Generation Z girls repurposed the sari worn by their mothers. They paired it with sneakers, casual knitwear, crop tops, T-shirts, black Oxford shoes, Y2K-inspired platform sandals, and sportswear. The dresses were often made in contrasting shades of grey, black, and blush pink seen as a sleek, modern, and corporate look.
