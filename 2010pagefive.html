  <h1>2010</h1>
  
  <p>  The 2010s were defined by hipster fashion, athleisure, a revival of austerity-era period pieces and alternative fashions, swag-inspired outfits, 1980s-style neon streetwear, and unisex 1990s-style elements influenced by grunge and skater fashions. The later years of the decade witnessed the growing importance in the western world of social media influencers paid to promote fast fashion brands on Pinterest and Instagram.</p>

<p>
Popular global fashion brands of the decade included Abercrombie and Fitch, Adidas, Balenciaga, Ben Sherman, Burberry, Christian Dior, Coach, DSquared2, Dorothy Perkins, Fashion Nova, Forever 21, Gucci, H&M, Hollister, Hugo Boss, Lacoste, Louis Vuitton, Marks and Spencer, Michael Kors, Monsoon Accessorize, Nike, Nine West, Off-White, River Island, Supreme, Topman, Topshop, Uniqlo, Under Armour, and Vans.</p>

Due to increased availability of the Internet and satellite television outside the United States, plus the reduction of import tariffs under NAFTA, fashion became more globalized and homogeneous in the late 1990s and early 2000s.

  The early 2010s saw many recycled fashions from the 1950s, 1970s, and 1980s as designers from stores like Topshop replicated original vintage clothing. In the United States, it was popular to wear Gucci, Chanel, or Versace designer clothing, and neon colors such as pink, green, teal, black, purple, magenta, and yellow.</p>

<p>Popular tops for American, British, and Australian women aged 20–50 included tunics, 1980s style baseball jackets,[20] oversized cardigans, western shirts, 2fer and layered shirts and tees, dresses and shirts worn with belts, Abercrombie and Fitch hoodies until 2012, Perfecto motorcycle jackets customized with studs, floral camisoles worn with matching boyshorts, and sundresses. European women wore sparkly dresses, baggy one-size-fits-all Empire line skirts, blouses and dresses, and lace, figure-hugging white organza maxi dresses inspired by Pippa Middleton.</p>

From 2010 to 2012 many late 2000s fashion trends remained popular in Europe, the United States, East Asia, Israel, and South America, especially acid wash skinny jeans, geometric or galaxy printed crew neck sweatshirts and leggings, "trouser-dresses", romper suits, preppy pastel colored skinny jeans, metallic dresses, and capri pants cropped at the ankle. Possibly due to the poor economy in the early years, the midi skirt and the maxi skirt were the most common skirt and dress styles, with the hemline standards being the longest they had been since The Great Depression.
